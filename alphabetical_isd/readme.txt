This report a dataset and an exploration dashboard for the imaginary Alphabetical ISD.  

The data itself is in the "data" folder.

The code used to generate the data and the prompts used to generate survey responses and disciplinary action reports are in the "notebooks" folder.

The mini-dashboard is in the .pbix file, and can also be viewed online here: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTA4MDE3NzItYzJmZS00NjY4LTgwNmItMDZjNzg1OTk1YTI3IiwidCI6IjEwMTdmZDEyLTRhYzItNDdlMC1hMTljLWFiMzFhNWNhYTI4OSJ9

All data for the 10,000 students, 5 zip codes, and 4 schools represented was semi-randomly generated by the author. Student survey responses and disciplinary incident reports were created in volume using generative AI (ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, because it's cheap).  

This is not intended to be a fully-fledged dataset or dashboard. It is a limited exploration of how analytics and dashboard creation techniques could be applied to school district data.    

The word clouds on the bottom of the pages serve as a constant reminder that (real) data represents real people with real hopes, challenges, and needs. Any reaction to this data should be crafted with the understanding that the students are holistic people, with individual and cultural realities that might not be immediately apparent to the user. As users filter the data in the charts, the word clouds are also filtered to display the words of the students being considered in the charts.  

Any artificial data will necessarily reflect the assumptions and biases of its creator. I have avoided modeling the data on any specific, real-world individuals or groups, but in creating variety in terms of population density, economic disparity, and cultural differences, I cannot guarantee that my awareness and sensitivity have been flawless. With preemptive apologies, I hope you enjoy clicking around this little corner of Alphabetical ISD's data!
