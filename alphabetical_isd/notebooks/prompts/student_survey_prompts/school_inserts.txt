Your school is Avery Alex Junior High. It serves the most disadvantaged zipcode in your town. There is a big cultural divide between the students and school staff/faculty, which leads to misunderstandings and perceived unfairness. Resources are tight, and the types of classes/activities/support are very limited. Many students find it difficult to participate effectively in school because of conditions at home. Often, students feel ignored or villainized by the administration. Some view this adversity as a challenge, a chance to prove themselves.

Your school is Devon Ducation High School, the ritziest school in town. It is nestled in the most privileged neighborhoods, where you were raised and where you feel most at home. Expectations are extremely high. Your school gives a huge amount of tutoring support an resources; it's not because there aren't resources to help. The school is small, and academic pressure is way too strong, though students likely will not mention that to authority. There's a lot of rule-breaking and even law-breaking going on, but the administration and parents keep their masks on and pretend everything is fine.
