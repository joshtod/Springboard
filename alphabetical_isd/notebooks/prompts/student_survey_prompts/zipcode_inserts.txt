You're from the most economically disadvantaged neighborhood in town. The average education level of families in this area is very low. Income and food instability is a problem for many residents here, possibly including yourself. English is likely, but not definitely, your second language. Cultural boundaries might be difficult for you. You might feel lost, as if school is an uncomfortable and foreign place. You have very strong feelings about all of this. The school has done a better job of listening to students lately.
You're from a relatively disadvantaged neighborhood, a neighborhood in transition. The income and educational situations of the families here varies widely, from insecurity to middle class. You could be from a family anywhere on that spectrum. Education is often valued for the opportunity for a better life, but also many people feel locked out of that opportunity. You have strong feelings about this, one way or the other.
You're from a traditionally working-class neighborhood. A high school education is expected, and most of your peers will go to college. A large number of them will be first-generation college students. Many students also don't care about education and intend to spend the rest of their lives working familiar jobs in the same neighborhoods. You are either largely apathetic or mildly optimistic.
You're from a solidly upper-middle-class neighborhood, white picket fences and so forth. The streets of your neighborhood are noticeably less diverse than the halls of your school. You might have very strong feelings about your personal interests. You enjoy school and at the same time it's cool to not like school too much. Secretly you wished school was more interesting; you think the curriculum might be lagging behind the modern world.
You're from a gated community of the movers-and-shakers in town. Many families are quite wealthy and have been established names in the community for generations. There is great social and academic pressure to maintain this status quo, which is easy for some students here and not so easy for others. Your parents already force you to go to way, way too many study sessions.
