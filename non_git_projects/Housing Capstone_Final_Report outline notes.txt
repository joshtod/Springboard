Capstone_Presentation

-Problem Statement
-Who Might Want To Know (also, wider impact)
-Explanation of data source (find from K)
-Interesting features
-Feature engineering? (best features)
-Modeling (cover page, flow chart (processing, splits, etc), model metrics, best model details, )
-Results - which is most influential?
-Limitations and future work





Capstone_Final_Report

Report:

1. Problem
	Can we meaningfully predict the price of a house based on its features?

2. Approach
	Clean the data
	Select our features
	Apply a selection of machine learning models
	
3. Findings (2-4 figures; core of story)

4. Up to 3 concrete use cases
	-Assessing ROI of new builds
	-Assessing ROI of renovations/addons
	-Identifying undervalued homes for purchase

5. Limitations
	Specific region / might not generalize
	Change over time
	Little transparency about collection; can't confirm representativeness
	" can't confirm accuracy



Final script:


Model Metrics (CSV or text; EASY TO READ):
	final model features
	--parameters
	--hyperparameters
	--performance metrics


ONGOING STEPS:
	--1. Determine real optimal params (running)
	--1.5 Make parameter report template
	--2. Re-run original notebook
	--3. Acquire real optimal parameters
	Paste params into txt doc
