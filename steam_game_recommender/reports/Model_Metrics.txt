Model: custom hybrid recommendation engine (collaborative + content-based with extra features)

'similar_user_limit': 250
'collab_filter_limit': 103
'content_filter_limit': 32
'double_bonus': 1.79
'popular_bias': 1.84
'ratio': 0.71
'recs': 20

NOTE:
- The "limit" parameters define the maximum number of returned values that part of the engine can include in its calculations.
- 'double_bonus' is used to boost the score of games that appear in both filters via: new_score = old_score + (old_score * double_bonus)
- 'popular_bias' is used to boost the score of games by their overall positive_review_percent on the Steam store via: new_score = old_score + (positive_review_percent * popular_bias)
- 'ratio' weights the collab & content filters via: final_score = (collab_score * ratio) + (content_score * (1-ratio)). This happens before double_bonus and popular_bias are applied.
- 'recs' is the number of games returned as recommendations.


Best model performance (via Bayesian optimization of the above parameters):

Test users: 100
Good recs: 30
Bad recs: 17
Total score: 13
