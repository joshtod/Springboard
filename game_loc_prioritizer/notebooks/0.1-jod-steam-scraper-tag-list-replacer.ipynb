    "When I initially scraped records (17,000+ records extant at the time of this notebook's creation, scraping at a rate of 200 games/hr), I only pulled the 7 most common tags from each game. Those were easier to get from the Steam store, since Steam displays them in a convenient location for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once I had enough records to begin analysis, I discovered that this made my feature space too sparse. Fewer than half of the records had 2 or more usable tags, and that's with a very generous definition of \"useful\" (specifically, \"appears in >5% of records\", which is super sparse in its own right).\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent scraping from scratch, we now have to devise a way to grab an extended tag list for each game and use it to replace the tag list in our existing data."
